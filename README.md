# Microsoft Excel
The data analyst course at CareerFoundry was project-based. For starting the course, I did the following project: 
# GameCo
## Objective
Analyze how GameCoâ€˜s new games might fare in the market
## Key Questions
1. Are certain types of games more popular than others?
2. What other publishers will likely be the main competitors in certain markets?
3. Have any games decreased or increased in popularity over time?
4. How have their sales figures varied between geographic regions over time?
## Data
CSV file from [VGChartz](https://www.vgchartz.com/)
## Presentation of findings
The findings were presented via an [PDF-Report](https://github.com/Gregor1000/GameCo/blob/6e85211bfd4522dbb10b32c27ec5a6e5b24b13a6/GameCo%20Final%20Project%20Presentation.pdf)
